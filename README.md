This dashboard can be used to help determine the similarity of text... regardless of what language it is in. Multiple language support (too many to list) allows for this to work with no translation. Results should be manually verified, and are not always correct. 



1.   Input API token into first cell and press play. 
2.   Enter source and input text into the second cell and press play.

This dashboard uses the (cited below) powerful HuggingFace Accellerated Inference API. You will need an API token from HF, and this can be obtained permanently by subscribing to the pro plan.

### To avoid Google entirely this entire notebook can be downloaded as .ipynb and run locally using Jupyter.
